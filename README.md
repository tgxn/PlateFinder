There are multiple sources for WA plate data, and this project aims to consolidate them into a single source, with a simple UI to search them.

## Data Format

There are several types of plate, from the most generic only giving us a rough year, to the more specific that can tell us the exact shire or council area.

### types

these all contain a `code` whcih can be either a prefix or a suffix, but with nothing before it.

- special
things like WPC and TAXI

- org_charity
like Cat Haven, Perth Zoo etc

- town_shire


- road_district
