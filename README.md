There are multiple sources for WA plate data, and this project aims to consolidate them into a single source, with a simple UI to search them.

Main Sources
- (warego.au)[https://warego.au/]
- (plate-planet.com)[http://www.plate-planet.com/bodypages/au-aust-wasshigr.html]
- (transport.wa.gov.au)[https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/district-series-plates.asp]

## Data Format

There are several types of plate, from the most generic only giving us a rough year, to the more specific that can tell us the exact shire or council area.

### types

these all contain a `code` whcih can be either a prefix or a suffix, but with nothing before it.

- special
things like WPC and TAXI

- org_charity
like Cat Haven, Perth Zoo etc

- town_shire


- road_district



## Data Sources

- inconsistent (does not list "K"-Karratha, despite it being in the header section...)
